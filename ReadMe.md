# Application Architecture
* ASP.NET Identity : Context boundaries, Using the UserManager & SignInManager, Extensions, JWT Token
* The Repository Pattern : Seperation of concerns-Minimise dublicate query logic-Decouple business code from data access-Testabilty-Increased level of abstraction-Increased level of maintainability, flexibility-More Classes/Interfaces-Business logic further away from data <br>
* Specification Pattern
* Error Handling and Exceptions
    -Developer exception page > Middleware > Swagger > Http response error > Custumize errors > Validations errors
##### For a specification pattern, we can simply say that it is a pattern that allows us to create reusable parts by encapsulating the domain information / rules we want.
Forms in Angular > Reactive Forms > Client Side Validation > Async Validation
* Related Data > Seeding Data > Pagination
- Performance, Parameters passing by query string, Page size should be limited, It should always page results
- To be implementing sorting, searching and pagination functionality in a list using the specification pattern
- Query commands are stored in variable
- Execution of the query is deferred : ToList(), ToArray(), ToDictionary(), Count() or other singleton queries
